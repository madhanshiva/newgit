# Getting Started with Your MS-102 : MICROSOFT 365 ADMINISTRATOR AND ESSENTIALS Workshop
 
Welcome to your MS-102 : MICROSOFT 365 ADMINISTRATOR AND ESSENTIALS workshop! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn about key elements of Microsoft 365 administration: Microsoft 365 tenant management, Microsoft 365 identity synchronization, and Microsoft 365 security and compliance. Let's begin by making the most of this experience:

> **Note:** `Once you launch the track, you’ll have access to a virtual machine (VM) for 40 hours. The displayed track duration of 4 days and 8 hours is based on an estimated usage of 8 hours per day. Please plan your lab sessions accordingly. If the VM uptime of 40 hours is fully exhausted before completing the labs, access will be lost. To avoid this, once you finish using the lab for the day, please stop or deallocate the VM from the Resources tab. Refer to the Managing Your Virtual Machine](#managing-your-virtual-machine) section for step-by-step instructions. `
 
> If the full 40 hours of VM uptime is exhausted, the VM will no longer be accessible, and **the lab duration cannot be extended**.

## Accessing Your Lab Environment
 
Once you're ready to dive in, your virtual machine and **Guide** will be right at your fingertips within your web browser.

## Managing Your Virtual Machine
 
1. Feel free to **Start, Stop, or Restart** your virtual machine as needed from the **Resources (1)** tab. Your experience is in your hands!

    - Once you finish using the lab for the day, please **stop or deallocate** the VM from the Resources tab as shown in the image below.
 
    - **Label (2)** indicates **starting the VM**, and **label (3)** indicates **stopping or deallocating** it. Stopping or deallocating the VM helps preserve the VM uptime limit so you can continue working the next day without exhausting the available uptime.
 
    - Please note that once the lab is launched, the overall lab session cannot be paused and will continue to run until the allotted time is fully consumed. Only the VM itself can be stopped or deallocated as described above.
