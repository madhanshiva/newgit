> **Note:** This lab uses the same virtual machine (VM) provided for the track.  
> Please make sure to stop or deallocate the VM after completing your lab activities for the day.  
> For detailed guidance on VM usage and management, refer to the **[Getting Started](sample.md)** page.


## Lab scenario

Contoso is exploring the hybrid model for its infrastructure services that would facilitate migration of its on-premises Windows servers to Azure virtual machines (VMs). To assist with this initiative, and you were tasked with evaluating the process of deploying Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain controllers in Azure VMs. Your intention is to identify differences between the manual process currently used for on-premises deployments and the deployment methods available in Azure. In addition, you want to test and document the Storage Migration Services functionality to validate its usage for migrations of on-premises file servers. 

>**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-801%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Upgrading%20and%20migrating%20in%20Windows%20Server)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same. 

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Deploy AD DS domain controllers in Azure.
- Migrate file servers by using Storage Migration Service.

## Estimated time: 2 hr 45 Minutes

## Exercise 1: Deploying AD DS domain controllers in Azure

In this exercise, you will learn how to deploy Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain controllers in Azure. The tasks cover the creation of a domain controller using an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template, the setup of Azure Bastion for secure access to your VMs, and the manual deployment of a second domain controller VM to expand your AD environment. This exercise focuses on understanding the key configurations required for AD DS in Azure, such as virtual networks, availability sets, and DNS configurations.

### Task 1: Deploy a domain controller by using an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template

In this task, you will deploy a domain controller using an ARM template. You will edit the template to adjust settings such as OS version, disk caching, and network configuration. You will also deploy the VM in an availability set and validate the deployment.

1. Select the **SEA-SVR2** from the top menu drop down.

    ![](../media/azm2-1.png)

1. If needed, sign in as **CONTOSO\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.

    ![](../media/azm2-2.png)

1. On **SEA-SVR2**, start **Microsoft Edge** from the task bar, right click on the following link [Create a new Windows VM and create a new AD Forest, Domain and DC](https://github.com/az140mp/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/application-workloads/active-directory/active-directory-new-domain), then select **Copy link** and then paste it on the browser to access a customized version of the QuickStart template

1. On the **Create a new Windows VM and create a new AD Forest, Domain and DC** page, select **Deploy to Azure**.

    ![](../Media/az6l1.png)

1. This will automatically redirect the browser to the **Create an Azure VM with a new AD Forest** page in the Azure portal.

1. When prompted, in the Azure portal, sign in by using following credentials:
   
   - Username: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
  
   - Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

1. On the **Create an Azure VM with a new AD Forest** page, select **Edit template**.

1. On the **Edit template** page, browse to the **storageProfile** section (starting with the line **195**) and verify that the **sku** (on line **199**) is set to **2022-Datacenter (1)**, if not then change it to 2022-Datacenter, and the **version** (on line **200**) is set to **latest (2)** and that **dataDisks** **caching** (on line **213**) is set to **None (3)**.

    > **Note:** Caching on the disks hosting AD DS database and log files should be set to **None**.

    ![](../Media/L6E1T1S6.png)

1. On the **Edit template** page, browse to the **extension** section (starting with the line **233**) and note that the template uses PowerShell Desired State Configuration to run the **CreateADPDC.ps1** script within the deployed Azure virtual machine (VM).

   > **Note:** To review the script, you can use the following steps:

	- On **SEA-SVR2**, open another tab in the Microsoft Edge window, and again access the customized version of QuickStart 
        template at **[Create a new Windows VM and create a new AD Forest, Domain and DC](https://github.com/az140mp/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/application-workloads/active-directory/active-directory-new-domain)**.

	- On the **Create a new Windows VM and create a new AD Forest, Domain and DC** page, in the listing of the repository content, 	select the **DSC** folder, and then select **CreateADPDC.ps1** file.
    
	- On the **azure-quickstart-templates/application-workloads/active-directory/active-directory-new-domain/DSC/CreateADPDC.ps1** 	page, review the content of the script and note that it installs a number of server roles, including Active Directory Domain 		Services and DNS, placing the NTDS database and logs, as well as the SYSOVL share on drive **F**.
     
	- Close the Microsoft Edge tab and switch back to the one displaying the **Edit template** page in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Edit template** page, browse to the section that provisions an availability set (starting with the line **110**) and note that the template creates an availability set and deploys the VM into it (as indicated by the **dependsOn** element on line **181**).

   >**Note:** Later in this exercise, you will deploy another Azure VM into the same availability set and configure it as an additional domain controller in the same domain. The use of an availability set provides additional resiliency.

1. Browse to the section that provisions the network interface of the Azure VM (starting with the line **152**) and note that the private IP address allocation method is set to **Static** (on line **164**).

   ![](../Media/L6E1T1S9.png)

   >**Note:** Using the static assignment is common when deploying domain controllers, but it is essential for servers that host the DNS server role.

1. Browse to the section that deploys a nested template(starting with line **266**) and note that the template updates the DNS server address within the virtual network hosting the Azure VM operating as a domain controller with the DNS server role installed.

   >**Note:** Configuring the custom DNS server virtual network setting that points to the Azure VM running the domain controller with the DNS server role ensures that any Azure VM subsequently deployed into the same virtual network will automatically use that DNS server for name resolution, effectively providing the domain join functionality.

1. On the **Edit template** page, select **Save** if changes were made to the template; otherwise, select **Discard**.

    ![](../Media/az6l2.png)

## Exercise 2: Migrating file servers by using Storage Migration Service

### Task 1: Set up file services

In this task, you will set up file services on the SEA-SVR2 machine by running a PowerShell script. The script will initialize additional data disks, create NTFS volumes, assign drive letters, and configure file shares that will be used in the file migration process.

1. On **SEA-SVR2**, on the taskbar, select **File Explorer**.

1. In File Explorer, browse to the **C:\\Labfiles\\Lab06 (1)** folder.

1. In File Explorer, in the details pane, select the file **L06_SetupFS.ps1 (2)**, right click on it to display its context menu, and then, in the menu, select **Edit (3)**.

    ![](../media/az-l6-16.png)

    >**Note:** This will automatically open the file **L06_SetupFS.ps1** in the script pane of Windows PowerShell ISE.

1. In the Windows PowerShell ISE script pane, review the script, and then execute it by selecting the **Run Script** icon in the toolbar or by pressing F5 then select **Run once**. 

    ![](../media/az-l6-17.png)

    >**Note:** Wait for the script to complete. This should take about 1 minute.

    >**Note:** The script initializes an extra data disk on **SEA-SVR1** and **SEA-SVR2**, creates an NTFS volume on each, assigns the **S:** drive letter to each volume, creates a share named **Data** using the **S:\Data** folder on **SEA-SVR1**, and adds to it sample files with a total size of about 1 GB.

   >**Note:** Click on **Run Once** when the pop-up comes up.
